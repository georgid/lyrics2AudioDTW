\begin_layout Abstract
Search by lyrics, the problem of locating the exact occurrences of a phrase
 from lyrics in musical audio, is a recently emerging research topic.
 Unlike key-phrases in speech, lyrical key-phrases have durations that bear
 important relation to other musical aspects like the structure of a composition.
 In this work we propose an approach that address the differences of syllable
 durations, specific for singing.
 First a phrase is expanded to MFCC-based phoneme models, trained on speech.
 Then, we apply dynamic time warping between the phrase and audio to estimate
 candidate audio segments in the given audio recording.
 Next, the retrieved audio segments are ranked by means of a novel score-informe
d hierarchical hidden Markov model, in which durations of the syllables
 within a phrase are explicitly modeled.
 The proposed approach is evaluated on 12 a-capella audio recordings of
 Turkish makam music.
 Relying on standard speech phonetic models, we arrive at an f-measure,
 comparable to a state-of-the-art work for the related task of keyword-spotting
 in singing.
 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work tackling the problem
 of search by lyrical key-phrases.
 We expect that it can serve as a baseline for further research on singing
 material with similar musical characteristics.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Searching by lyrics is the problem of locating the exact occurrences of
 a key-phrase from textual lyrics in musical signal
\color black
.
 It has inherent relation to the 
\color inherit
problem of keyword spotting in speech, 
\begin_inset Note Note

(therefore it is a.k.a.
 keyword spotting in singing)
\end_layout

 which is a long-investigated research task
\begin_inset Note Note

.
 In keyword spotting, a user is interested to find at which time position
 in speech a relevant keyword (presenting a topic of interest) is spoken.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color black
Most of the work on searching for keywords/keyphrases in singing has borrowed
 concepts and ideas from its equivalent problem for speech.

\color inherit
 For spoken utterances phonemes have relatively similar duration across
 speakers.
 Unlike that, in singing durations of phoneme (especially vowels) have higher
 variation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kruspekeyword"

\end_inset

.
 When being sung, vowels 
\color black
are prolonged according to musical note values.
 Therefore, adopting an approach from speech recognition might lack some
 singing-specific semantics, including among others durations of sung syllables.

\color inherit
 Furthermore, in comparison to keyword spotting, we believe that key-phrase
 detection has higher potential to be integrated with other relevant MIR-applica
tions, because lyrical key-phrases are often correlated to musical structure.
 For most types of music a section-long lyrical phrase is a feature that
 represents the corresponding structural section (e.g.
 chorus) in a unique way.
 Therefore correctly retrieved audio segments for, for example, the first
 lyrics line for a chorus can serve as a structure discovery tool.

\begin_layout Standard
In this work we investigate searching by lyrics in the case when a query
 represents an entire section or phrase from the textual lyrics of a particular
 composition.
 Unlike keyword-spotting or query-by-humming where a hit would be a document
 from an entire collection, in our case a hit is the occurrence of a phrase,
 being retrieved only from the performances of the given composition.
 In this respect the problem setting is more similar to linking melodic
 patterns from score to musical audio (addressed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "anonymity"

\end_inset

), rather than to keyword-spotting.
  We assume that the musical score with lyrics is present for the composition
 of interest.
 The proposed approach has been tested on a small dataset of a-cappella
 performances from a repertoire of Turkish makam music.
 For a given performance, the composition is known in advance, but no informatio
n about the structure is given.
 Characteristic for makam music is that, in a performance there might be
 reordering or repetitions of score sections.

Keyword spotting in singing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color black
A recent work proved that keyword spotting in singing voice is a hard problem
 even when singing material is acapella (from pop songs in English) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kruspekeyword"

\end_inset

.
 The authors adopt an approach from spotting keywords for speech, using
 a compound hidden Markov model (HMM) with keyword and filler model.
 Keywords are automatically extracted from a textual collection of lyrics.
 This work's best classifier (multi-layer perceptron) yielded an f-measure
 of 44%, averaged over top 50% of keywords.
 Notably, the achieved results on singing material are not very different
 from results on spoken utterances of same keywords.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the few attempts to go beyond keywords is the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "fujihara2008hyperlinking"

\end_inset

.
 Their goal is to automatically link phrases that appear in the lyrics of
 one song to the same phrase in another song.
 To this end, a keyword-filler model is utilized for detecting characteristic
 phrases (of 2-3 words) in sung audio.
 The method has been evaluated on polyphonic audio from Japanese pop.

\color red
 
\color black
The key-phrase spotting module itself is not evaluated, but it can be inferred
 from the performance of the whole linking system, that an upper bound lies
 around an accuracy of 30%.

 A non-HMM-based approach has been chosen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "dittmar2012towards"

\end_inset

.
 The authors propose subsequence dynamic time warping (DTW) to find a match
 to an example utterance of a keyword as a subsequence of features from
 a target recording.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color black
In summary, performance of state-of-the-art work in keyword and key-phrase
 spotting for singing is not sufficiently good for practical applications.
 A probable reason for this is that hitherto approaches do not take into
 account the duration of syllables, which, as stated above, is an important
 factor that distinguishes speech from singing.
 In addition to that, syllable durations have been shown to be a strong
 reinforcing cue for the related task of automatically synchronizing lyrics
 and singing voice

Position-aware DBN-HMMs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The modeling in most of the above mentioned approaches relies on classical
 HMMs with single hidden variable.
 A drawback of HMMs is that their capability to model exact state durations
 is restricted.
 The wait time in a state is implicitly set to a geometric distribution
 (derived from the self-transition likelihood).

\color red
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One alternative to tackle durations can be seen in dynamic Bayesian networks
 (DBN), which allow modeling of any relations among phenomena in terms of
 probabilistic dependencies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "murphy2002dynamic"

\end_inset

.
 DBNs can be used to represent HMMs with more than one latent variable
\color black
.
 Thus makes them attractive to model interdependent musical aspects.
 Such an aspect is, for example, the position in musical score.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "holzapfelsection"

\end_inset

 it has been shown that the dependence of score position on structural sections
 makes it possible to link musical performances to score.

\color blue
 
\color black
A system for beat-tracking was presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "krebs2013rhythmic"

\end_inset

, for which a latent variable tracks the position in a musical bar.
 These approaches have in common the strategy to  assign a variable that
 tracks some musical aspect with sequential nature.
 In this paper, for brevity we will refer to HMMs, which use DBNs to describe
 their hidden states as DBN-HMMs.
 Inspired by concepts from these works, we model the position of a musical
 section by a DBN-HMM, in a way that integrates syllable durations and the
 features, capturing phoneme acoustics.

System Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 1 presents an overview of the proposed approach.
 We suggest a two-stage retrieval approach: On the first stage a subsequence
 DTW retrieves a set of candidate audio segments that 
\color black
are acoustically similar to
\color inherit
 a simple query with no duration information.
 On the second stage, a the phonemes from the query and syllable durations
 are modeled by a novel DBN-HMM aware of the position in music score (in
 short position-DBN-HMM).
 Next, we run a Viterbi decoding on each candidate segment separately.
 Viterbi assures that only one (the most optimal) path is detected for the
 candidate audio segment.
 Any query-to-audio fullpath match is considered as a hit and all hit results
 are ranked according to the weights derived from the Viterbi decoded path.
 In what follows each of the two stages is described in details, preceded
 by remarks on how a query key-phrase is handled.

Tempo Estimation

\begin_layout Standard
Often a performance is not played at the tempo indicated in the score.
 We follow the method of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 pitch-values for the first section from the score.
 The angle of the most salient diagonal matching line segment in the distance
 matrix reveals the actual tempo

Acoustic features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each of the 38 Turkish phonemes (and for a silent pause model) a 3-state
 HMM is trained from a corpus of turkish speech.
 The 3 states represent respectively the beginning, middle and ending acoustic
 state of a phoneme.
 The acoustic properties (most importantly the formant frequencies) of spoken
 phonemes can be induced from the spectral envelope of speech.
 To this end, we utilize the first 12 MFCCs and their delta to the previous
 time instant.
 For each state a 9-mixture Gaussian distribution is fitted on the feature
 vector.

 For each syllable a reference duration (in units of

 of the leftmost path until the final timestamp of the rightmost path (both
 marked with yellow dotted line in the figure).
 We assume that a concentration of found paths within a segment suggests

In this section, we present a novel probabilistic model for modeling a lyrical
 phrase.
 The main idea of the model is to incorporate the phonetic identities of
 lyrics and the syllable durations, available from musical score, into a
 coherent unit.
 The dependence of the observed acoustic features (that capture the phonetic
 identity) on musical velocity and score position are presented as DBN in
 figure

 The derivation of model dependencies and parameters is the main contribution

The MAP for the complete system has a peak when considering first 3 hits
 from the ranked result list.
 This is expected because 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{C_{q}}=3.2$
\end_inset

.
 In general MAPS after decoding of candidate segment with position-modeling,
 is substantially better than the baseline, which suggests that modeling
 syllable durations is beneficial.
 Another reason might be that the position-DBN-HMM models tempo and is thus
 insucceptible to the difference between the tempo indicated in the score
 and the real performance tempo.

 a result is considered true positive if a keyword is detected at any position
 in an expected audio clip.
 The authors argue that since a clip spans one line of lyrics (only 1 to
 10 words) this is sufficiently exact, whereas we are interested in detecting
 the exact timestamps of a key-phrase.
 In addition to that, their longest query has 8 phonemes, which is much
 less than the average in our setting.

 highest score for a song has been considered, which might ignore any other
 true positives.

 These results make us suggest that, although the evaluation setting of

 rates, because in all cases when

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study we have investigated an important problem that has started
 to attract attention of researchers only recently.
 We tackle the linking between audio and structural sections from the perspectiv
e of lyrics: we proposed a method for searching in musical audio for the
 occurrences of a characteristic section-long lyrical phrase.
 We presented a novel DBN-based HMM for tracking in a score-informed way
 sung phonemes and their durations.
 Evaluation on a-cappella material from Turkish makam music shows that the
 search with the proposed model brings substantial improvement compared
 to a baseline system, unaware of syllable-duration information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We plan to focus future work on applying the proposed model to the case
 of polyphonic singing.
 We expect further, that this work can serve as a baseline for further research
 on singing material with similar musical characteristics.

Can be applied for structure detection in performances where the structure
 of the piece might differ significantly form the score (andre describes
 this well).
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We want to point as well that, the proposed score-informed scheme is applicable
 not necessarily only when musical scores are available.
 Scores can be replaced by any format, from which duration information can
 be inferred: for example annotated melodic contour or singer-created indication
s along the lyrics.

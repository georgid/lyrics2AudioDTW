Goal: 
==========================
compare the timing behaviour of the alignment in two settings: with and without lyrics duration information. 
Duration information is inferred for each lyrics syllable by reading off the score the note durations of its associated musical notes. 


We aim a score-informed alignment inspired by the idea of linking audio to a melody synthesized by the score [sertans sec linking]. 
In a similar way to synthesizing a reference melodic contour, templates of phonemes are concatenated into a template sequence with their corresponding durations.


MEthod:
-------------------------------------
we run a classic DTW to find the most optimal path on a cost matrix between a reference template sequence  and audio segments from sarki recordings.
The reference template sequence is expanded by concatenating the HMM models of the phoneme sequence, corresponding to the lyrics.
HMMs are trained on turkish speech corpus 

cost function =  P(y|x) - the observation probability

-----------------------------

When duration is used, the phoneme templates are repeated as much as to reflect the syllable durations. 
Each consonants in a syllable is assigned a fixed duration (1/32) 

Basically the observation probs. are used, no transition probs.  [Here some ref. to DTW ]
In the path no skips are allowed, but only staying in same state or going to next with equal probability. Motivation for this is that we want to resemble froced alignment 




experimental setting 1: 
=--------------------------

data: 
=======
- clean singing voice with no accompaniment, segmented into sections. 10 sections of ~10 seconds each

- features: MFCCs from HTK



evaluation criteria for comparison :
- alignment error


ANALYSIS:
--------------------
optional : - how straight are lines ? 





results: 
----------------------------


parameters: 
ADJUSTABLE: 
- with and Without mfcc deltas. make sure models are not changed if I take only the mfcc deltas
- (sp or no sp). because there are mandatory and not optional in the modeling in dtw

- MFCCs type: from Slaney (Essentia? ); from Durrieu

NOTE: features are different from HTK:
- no cepstral mean norm done
- no transitional probs used

Goal: 
compare the timing behaviour of the alignment in two settings: with and without lyrics duration information. 
Duration information is inferred for each lyrics syllable by reading off the score the note duration of its associated tones.

We adopt a score-informed alignment inspired by the idea of linking audio to melody present in the score [sertans sec linking]. 

In a similar way to synthesizing a reference melodic contour, templates of phonemes are concatenated into a template sequence with their corresponding durations.

To do proof of concept, we run a classic DTW between the reference template sequence and audio segments from sarki recordings.


experimental setting 1: 

- clean singing voice with no accompaniment, segmented into sections. 10 sections of ~10 seconds each
- templates = HMM models from turkish speech corpus (states of each HMM)
- features: MFCCs from HTK



evaluation criteria for comparison :
- alignment error
- how straight are lines ? 





results: 


parameters: 
- with and Without mfcc deltas. make sure models are not changed if I take only the mfcc deltas
- (sp or no sp). because there are mandatory and not optional in the modeling in dtw

- MFCCs type: from Slaney (Essentia? ); from Durrieu

NOTE: features are different from HTK:
- no cepstral mean norm done
- no transitional probs used


Future Work: 
- semi hidden markov models
- read orio;s note duration model, or filips master thesis.

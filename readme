Module developed for proof of concept: is timing information from note durations of score helpful to improve alignment? 


criteria:
- alignment error

========================================
main function: doit

-	getObsProbGMM_MFCCs - with no timing info
	getObsProbGMM_MFCCs_duraions - with durations info

- read MFCCs features for file extracted with htk, 
- load trained HMM speech models
- for each model (each line) compute for all audio the obs probs as cost and use in cost matrix

======================================

Evaluation run in python : $GITdir/AllignmentStep/dtw/evalDTWmatlab
 


current work: efforts to do scaling of visualisation imscale with hard threshold

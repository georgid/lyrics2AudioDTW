Module developed for proof of concept: is timing information from note durations of score helpful to improve alignment? 

criteria:
- alignment error
- how straight are lines ? 

main function readme

getObsProbGMM_MFCCs - with no timing info
getObsProbGMM_MFCCs_duraions - with durations info

----

- read MFCCs features for file extracted with htk, 
- load trained HMM speech models
- for each model (each line) compute for all audio the obs probs as cost


Evaluation run in python : doitForOneFile
 

current work: efforts to do scaling of visualisation imscale with hard threshold

----------
llimitations of loading files :
TODO: in visualize load TextGrid instead of separate .annoFile
TODO: read start and end NoteNum from .tsv file instead giving manually

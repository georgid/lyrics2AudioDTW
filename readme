Module developed for proof of concept: is timing information from note durations of score helpful to improve alignment? 

The repetition of states enforces some minimal duration corresponding to the note durations.

for more details see report file


eval. criteria :
- alignment error

========================================
main function: doit

-	getObsProbGMM_MFCCs - with no timing info
	getObsProbGMM_MFCCs_duraions - with durations info

- read MFCCs features for file extracted with htk, 
- load trained HMM speech models
- for each model (each line) compute for all audio the obs probs as cost and use in cost matrix

======================================

Evaluation run in python : $GITdir/AllignmentStep/dtw/evalDTWmatlab
 


current work: efforts to do scaling of visualisation imscale with hard threshold

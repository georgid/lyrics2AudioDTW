Goal: 
==========================
Query by lyrics 


The goal is not to find occurences of individual words. Instead we define a query to be an entire section of lyrics (5-8 words). 
This falicitates a new way of detection of structural sections. 
It Makes sence to rely on lyrics for structural information since lyrics is the most stable musical aspect, present in musical score.   
( TODO: explain : Singers dont improvise lyrics, unlike they can melody or dynamics

with lyrics duration information. 
Duration information is inferred for each lyrics syllable by reading off the score the note durations of its associated musical notes. 

copy why duration is important


MEthod:
-------------------------------------

General concept of method: TODO: cut

Two-step approach:
High-level detection. 

We aim a score-informed inspired by the idea of linking audio to a melody synthesized by the score [sertans sec linking]. 
In a similar way to synthesizing a reference melodic contour, templates of phonemes are concatenated into a template sequence with their corresponding durations.



1. estimate tempo: from Sertan

1.5 silence detection (why: the dist metric in silent sections is similar to all models )
implement: blacklist (in two steps) in results of dtw
or
put 0 and 1s in cost matrix

Cost matrix : reference template sequence (on the vertical axis )
and audio feature vectors (horizontal)



4. blacklisting

5. weighting of paths
according to a threshold at the peak of a histogram - inspired by the vowel chart? 



scirpt`: visualizePath()
-----------------------------

When duration is used, the phoneme templates are repeated as much as to reflect the syllable durations. 
Each consonants in a syllable is assigned a fixed duration (1/32) 

Basically the observation probs. are used, no transition probs.  [Here some ref. to DTW ]




experimental setting 1: 
=--------------------------

data: 
=======
- clean singing voice with no accompaniment, segmented into sections. 10 sections of ~10 seconds each

- features: MFCCs from HTK



evaluation criteria for comparison :
- alignment error


ANALYSIS:
--------------------
optional : - how straight are lines ? 





results: 
----------------------------


parameters: 
ADJUSTABLE: 
- with and Without mfcc deltas. make sure models are not changed if I take only the mfcc deltas
- (sp or no sp). because there are mandatory and not optional in the modeling in dtw

- MFCCs type: from Slaney (Essentia? ); from Durrieu

NOTE: features are different from HTK:
- no cepstral mean norm done
- no transitional probs used
